## Research Plan

##### July 5 - 7:  
 - Convert graph and neueral net generation to juptyer notebook
 - ~~Figure out how to save graph as file~~
 - Create documentation for neural network generation
 - Figure out how to save neural net model
 - Create neural net visualization

##### July 10 - 14:  
 - Improve graph (and add more data)
 - Use Dream3D hdf5 files instead of csv
 - Clean up code to use pandas (instead of dictionaries)
 - Explore FIPs (look at PRISMS-Fatigue computational framework)
 - Start generating crack and banding files
 - Look into using voxels (instead of grain features)

##### July 17 - 21:  
 - Start implementing cracks into graph network
 - Results from finite element modeling and how to include into graph network
 - Start with possibly using descriptor (so maybe standard deviation) at grain level
 - Then look into using voxel level
 - Document findings and start drafting write-up

##### July 24 - 28:   
 - Start training GNN on cracked (high cycle fatigue) grain structure
 - Try to predict growth rate first
 - Visualize and analyze findings
 - Tweak input parameters (node features and edges)
 - Document findings and continue drafting write-up

##### July 31 - August 4:   
 - Flex week to catch up
 - Look at using heterogeneous GNN for voxels and grains (different nodes)
 - Start looking into predicting crack growth direction
